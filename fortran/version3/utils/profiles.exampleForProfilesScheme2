# This file is an example 'profiles' file appropriate for profilesScheme=1 and 2 species.
# Any lines that begin with # or ! or % are comments (ignored).
# The first line which is not a comment must be just a single integer: 0, 1, 2, or 3,
# giving the radial coordinate which will be used in this file, using the same convention
# as inputRadialCoordinate:
# 0 = psiHat
# 1 = psiN
# 2 = rHat
# 3 = rN
1
# This radial coordinate need not be the same as inputRadialCoordinate in the input.namelist file.
#
# Next comes a whitespace-delimited array of data with 2*Nspecies+3 columns.
# The order of the columns is:
# NErs   dPhiHatdXXX_min   dPhiHatdXXX_max   nHat(species 1)   THat(species 1)   nHat(species 2)   THat(species 2) ...
# In the dPhiHatdXXX quantities here, XXX must correspond to inputRadialCoordinateForGradients in the input.namelist file.
# These quantities and NErs matter only for scanType=5 (a scan of Er at each radius), and they correspond
# to the sfincsScan !ss parameters of the same name.
# For scanType=4 (a scan over radius with no scan of Er), NErs, dPhiHatdXXX_min, and dPhiHatdXXX_max are ignored.
# The density and temperature values are all normalized to nBar and TBar, just as in the input.namelist file.
#
# The rows correspond to coefficients of a polynomial, beginning
# with the constant term, e.g.
# nHat = a_0 + a_1 * x + a_2 * x^2 + a_3 * x^3
# where x is whichever radial coordinate you selected.  Regularity at x=0 requires that all the odd polynomial
# coefficients vanish when rHat or rN is used as the radial coordinate in this file, but this requirement is not enforced.
# You can include as many rows as you like, i.e. the polynomial order can be as high as you like.
#
# NErs  dPhiHatdXXX_min   dPhiHatdXXX_max   nHat(species 1)   THat(species 1)   nHat(species 2)   THat(species 2)
