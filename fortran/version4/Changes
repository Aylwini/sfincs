Aspects of the code that have changed in version 4 compared to version 3:

* The finite-difference grid in theta and zeta has been replaced with Fourier modal expansions.
  Associated with this change, the variables Ntheta and Nzeta are replaced by NFourier, mmax, and nmax.
  Associated preconditioner options and differentiation matrix options have been removed.

* Upwinding of the xDot term has been removed. This feature was never used.

* The main datatype has changed from PetscScalar to real(prec), which corresponds to double precision
  regardless of whether a single- or double-precision PETSc library is used. This change facilitates
  working with single-precision PETSc libraries.

* Removed Ntheta, Nzeta, NxPotentialsPerVth and xMax from sfincsScan_1. Added NFourier, mmax, and nmax.

* Some variables in evaluateResidual.F90 were renamed to avoid references to 'right hand side',
  which is obsolete now that we think in terms of a residual function.
