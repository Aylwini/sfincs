# First load the following modules:
# module load petsc/3.5-intel12-ompi16-real hdf5/1.8-intel12-ompi16
# old:
# module load petsc/3.3-intel12-ompi16-real hdf5/1.8-intel12-ompi16
# Also set the following environment variable:
# setenv SFINCS_SYSTEM=hgw
# (You might wish to put the above line in your .tcshrc file.)
# Then run 
# make clean
# make -j

# These next 2 includes set FC, FLINKER, and PETSC_LIB:
include ${PETSC_DIR}/conf/variables
include ${PETSC_DIR}/conf/rules

# Any other flags for compiling, such as -I include flags:
EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS = -I${HDF5_DIR}/include -I${PETSC_DIR}/include

# Any other flags for linking, such as -l library flags:
EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS = -L${HDF5_DIR}/lib -lhdf5_fortran -lhdf5

# The next parameters are used only for running selected examples "make test"

# For "make test", do you want to run the examples that require multiple nodes wor\
th of memory?
# The value of this variable must be "yes" or "no".
SFINCS_RUN_LARGE_EXAMPLES=yes

# For "make test", are runs submitted using a batch system (such as PBS)?
# The value of this variable must be "yes" or "no".
SFINCS_IS_A_BATCH_SYSTEM_USED=yes

# (MJL 20140916) I'm guessing at the next line - you might need to change this.
# Also for any example you wish to run with "make test", you would need to write
# a job.hydra file.
