\chapter{Quasisymmetry in other coordinate systems}
\label{a:Hamada}

In this appendix, we prove that $B$ has a single helicity in Boozer
coordinates if and only if $B$ has a single helicity in Hamada coordinates.
The result which is proved is actually more general, that symmetry is
equivalent for any magnetic coordinate system in which the Jacobian is
proportional to some power of $B$. Preliminary results are derived in the
next three sections which are used for the proof in the last section.
