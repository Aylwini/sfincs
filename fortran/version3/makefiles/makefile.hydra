# To compile on hydra, first load the following modules:
# module load petsc-real hdf5-serial netcdf-serial
# Also set the following environment variable:
# export SFINCS_SYSTEM=hydra
# (You might wish to put the above line in your .bashrc file.)
#
# Then run 
# make clean
# make -j
#
# To use the plotting routines in utils/ you also need to load the following modules:
# module load python27/python python27/scipy python27/h5py

# These next 2 includes set FC, FLINKER, and PETSC_LIB:
# For PETSc version 3.6.0 and later, use the following 2 lines:
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/variables
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/rules
# The next 2 lines are used instead of the above 2 lines for PETSc versions prior to 3.6.0:
#include ${PETSC_DIR}/conf/variables
#include ${PETSC_DIR}/conf/rules

# Any other flags for compiling, such as -I include flags:
EXTRA_COMPILE_FLAGS = -I${HDF5_HOME}/include -I${PETSC_DIR}/include -I${NETCDF_HOME}/include

# Any other flags for linking, such as -l library flags:
EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS = -L${HDF5_HOME}/lib -lhdf5_fortran -lhdf5 -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5hl_fortran -L${NETCDF_HOME}/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff


# The next parameters are used only for running selected examples "make test"

# For "make test", are runs submitted using a batch system (such as PBS)?
