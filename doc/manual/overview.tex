SFINCS is a nifty code \cite{sfincsPaper}.


\section{\sfincs~vs. \sfincsScan}
The fortran part of \sfincs~ solves the kinetic equation for each species
at a single flux surface, a single value of $E_r$, and a single set of resolution parameters.
However, often the goal is to determine the ambipolar $E_r$ at one or more surfaces.
For this task, the \sfincsScan~family of python scripts

all collisionless trajectories are confined.  (b) In contrast, trapped particles in other stellarators
may have a radial drift that does not average to zero.
