# module load petsc-real hdf5-serial netcdf-serial
# Also set the following environment variable:
# export SFINCS_SYSTEM=hydra
# (You might wish to put the above line in your .bashrc file.)
#
# Then run 
# make clean
# make -j

# To use the plotting routines in utils/ you also need to load the following modules:
# module load python27/python python27/scipy python27/h5py
